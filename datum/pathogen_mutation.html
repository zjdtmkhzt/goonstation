<p>Pathogen Mutations</p>
<p>All possible mutation effects are a child of /datum/pathogen_mutation.
These will be automatically chosen at random as candidates for mutation.
There are a number of factors deciding whether or not a certain kind of mutation will occur. If a mutation's criteria are not satisfied,
new mutations are chosen until one with satisfied criteria is found. The default mutations are defined so that no situation may arise
where a mutation cannot be picked. Regardless, if all mutations defined are unsatisfied, a mutation will not occur.</p>
<p>Each mutation may occur exactly session_maximum times per mutation session.
This is in to prevent abusing the mutation system for gathering a large amount of symptoms quickly.
Symptom gaining mutations are also purposefully made harder to gain very deadly symptoms.</p>
<p>Mutation criteria for malicious mutations:</p>
<ul>
<li>For a malicious mutation to occur on a pathogen, its maliciousness must be greater or equal to the mutation's maliciousness threshold.</li>
<li>For this mutation to occur, its maliciousness must be no greater than its maliciousness limit, unless the limit is lower than the
threshold.</li>
<li>For this mutation to occur, the pathogen's mutativeness must be greater than the mutativeness threshold if it's an evolution, or
lower than the mutativeness threshold if it's a devolution. It may also occur on equality.</li>
<li>If all the above criteria are satisfied, the chance of this mutation actually occurring is
chance_base + maliciousness * chance_modifier</li>
</ul>
<p>Mutation criteria for benevolent mutations:</p>
<ul>
<li>For a benevolent mutation to occur on a pathogen, its maliciousness must be less or equal to the mutation's maliciousness threshold.</li>
<li>For this mutation to occur, its maliciousness must be no less than its maliciousness limit, unless the limit is higher than the
threshold.</li>
<li>For this mutation to occur, the pathogen's mutativeness must be greater than the mutativeness threshold if it's an evolution, or
lower than the mutativeness threshold if it's a devolution. It may also occur on equality.</li>
<li>If all the above criteria are satisfied, the chance of this mutation actually occurring is
chance_base - maliciousness * chance_modifier</li>
</ul>
<p>The mutation code must be in the mutate proc of the child type. It will be executed automatically if the mutation occurs.</p></main>
